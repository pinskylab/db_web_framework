# To do list for web app and MySQL server development

## General Tasks
1face. Figure out how to host the web app so people can access it

## MySQL Tables
1. Creation of Extraction tables
    1. Metadata
    2. Archive
    4. Plate Table
2. IACUC table (talk to Malin about the layout)
3. Genomic data and storage
    1. Kyra said maybe make the format the same as the upload format for GEOME or where it it gets uploaded

## Data logging 
1. Create plate upload format
    1. This is likely connecting two different tables.
    2. The sample ID needs to connect to the extraction ID which will have the plate information if applicable. The plate table would then have metadata regarding the plate itself like the archive.
    3. I think it would me one of the more simple upload formats. 
2. Extraction Metadata
    1. Similar to the current upload CSV likely just duplicated and fields added or changed to be relevant for extraction metadata
3. Archive Extractions
    1. Identical to the the 81 or 49.
    2. Individual tube extractions mostly historical but some contemporary samples too.
4. Sample Use log will have all information that IACUC may need? (still ask Malin about this)
5. 

## Data Querying
1. 

## General HTML stuff
1. Some kind of desciption in boxes for unloading or querying data
2. Box grid labels
    1. EX. 1-9 on top, A-I on side
3. Feedback for submitting stuff
